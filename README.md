# python_package_automation

This is a template that contains workflows to automatically perform testing, publish release assets and push them to pypi on release, issue templates, workflow cleanup, and some quality-of-life for python packages.

## How to use this template

### Setup

* First, think of a name for your package. Make sure it's not yet taken on pypi and testpypi.
* Second, click 'use this template' in the upper right corner
* Name your repository the name you have just thought of (I discourage the use of dashes here, since it can be quite annoying if your package is called differently on pypi and in the program), set a description and choose a license. This will enable the setup workflow to automatically fill in some of the details in the package files.
* You should now see a job 'setup' pop up (after ca. 10 sec, you might have to refresh the page). Wait for it to finish and move on.

## Automated distribution on release

* Sign up for an account at testpypi and pypi
* Under account settings (in your pypi account) select API tokens and create a new one with the **permission to upload to the entire account**.
* Go to the settings page in your repo and select secrets, click 'add secret' and paste your token from testpypi into a secret named 'TEST_PYPI_PASSWD' and the one from pypi to 'PYPI_PASSWD'.
* You are now able to create a release. Choose a tag name that contains only alphanumericals, underscores and dots. If you select 'This is a prerelease', your package will only be uploaded to testpypi, if you don't, it will be uploaded to both testpypi and pypi.

## ReadTheDocs

If you want to host your documentation on ReadTheDocs, everything is already set up for you. Just go to [readthedocs.org](readthedocs.org), create a new project, and fill in some details. (Pro tip: Link your GitHub with RTD and choose to generate previews for pull-requests. You'll see :) )

## Automatic unittesting

* If you're familiar with the python testing framework `unittest`, this is for you.
* Write your test like you normally would. With every push, your tests are run against the code you wrote. If your project depends on libraries, you can add a `requirements.txt` file at the root level, or just let `setup.py` do it's thing.

## FOSSA analysis

If you want to use FOSSA to analyze your code for license violations, vulnerabilities and quality management (coming soon), you can include a fossa api key in your secrets as `FOSSA_API_KEY`.

## Some extra stuff

* Tests are automatically skipped if no tests are found
* Tests have to be in files following the pattern `test*.py`
* If the code changes are from a pull-request, a comment in the discussion about the test results will be made
* Take a look at [shields.io](shields.io) and search for 'github'. You'll get an idea of what badges in your readme can be used for!
* You can use the placeholder `[vermin]` in your release notes. It will dynamically be replaced with the version requirements of this package.
* For codespaces users: It might take some time for the config to be loaded successfully. After loading into the codespace for the first time, just lean back for a minute, don't touch anything and then hit refresh.
